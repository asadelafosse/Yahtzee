Yahtzee Solitaire by SÃ©bastien

The accompanying game is a tribute to the famous dice game owned by Hasbro (not me), and coded for JavaFX.
This was an exercise to practice my skills in Java coding, and in no way intended as an infringement on any copyrights.

For full rules of the game, please see: http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/yahtzee.pdf

In order to run the game, please run src.main.java.com.ivik.yahtzee.Game in this repository.

Use the checkboxes to save a die roll, or uncheck to reroll.
Click "Score" to record your score in the corresponding score box. Your total score is automatically updated.
Try to score multiple Yahtzees in a single game.
(Those are worth extra points, and there are special rules about where you may record such scores.)
If you are among the best 10, you may record your name in the Hall of Fame!

Have fun!
