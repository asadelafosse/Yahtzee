Yahtzee Solitaire by asadelafosse

The accompanying game is a tribute to the famous dice game owned by Hasbro (not me), and coded for JavaFX.
This is an exercise to practice my skills in Java coding.
I am in no way monetising this program or intending to harm or diminish the profits by the owner of the copyright.

For full rules of the game, please see: http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/yahtzee.pdf

In order to run the game, please run src.main.java.com.ivik.yahtzee.Game in this repository.

Use the checkboxes to save a die roll, or uncheck to reroll.
Click "Score" to record your score in the corresponding score box. Your total score is automatically updated.
Try to score multiple Yahtzees in a single game.
(Those are worth extra points, and there are special rules about where you may record such scores.)
If you are among the best 10, you may record your name in the Hall of Fame!

Have fun!
